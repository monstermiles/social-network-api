        ## Description
        This is a back-end application for a simple social networking site. It allows you to view, add, update, and delete users and thoughts, as well as add users to friends lists and react to other user's thoughts. It is made using Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose. I used Insomnia for testing the routes. 


        Here are some links to walkthrough videos. Its long. Sorry.
